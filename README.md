# cplex-sample
a cplex samle , find optimal locations of new stores, copied ibm cplex jupyter notebook sample, the sample couldn't run , debug it and make it works.
the error is, string run out of range, I guess the chicago public data changed it format, json data add or deleted some data, made the sample doesn't work.
